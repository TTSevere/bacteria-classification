# Capstone Project - Bacteria classification

## Background

Bacteria-related illnesses – caused by strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio cholerae, Corynebacterium diptheriae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa—are responsible for approximately 5 million deaths per year worldwide. Many of these infectious diseases are not only prevalent in the developing world, but are becoming more common in the developed world with increasing instances of food contamination, hospital-acquired infections, and bioterrorism.

Identification and monitoring of bacteria outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance is critical for tracking health developments and is recommended by the WHO. Current microbial identification approaches can be extraordinarily time consuming, laborious, and expensive. Specifically, in the case of gold-standard clinical microbiology assays, such as staining and microscopy following culture on solid media in Petri dishes, the assistance of experts for morphological identification is required. Furthermore, these identification methods are often sample destructive. Thus, the development of a rapid, automated process to identify and characterize bacterial species from environmental and clinical samples would be a major health
innovation. 

The aim of this proposal is to develop a machine-learning based approach for the identification and characterization of bacteria via analysis of photographs of bacteria colonies from environmental samples grown on solid media in Petri dishes. The aim would be to build towards machine learning algorithm which could classify colonies on a plate into species, based on aspects such as colony morphology, color, and other features.
