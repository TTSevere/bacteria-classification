# Capstone Project Plan

## Timeline:

What we need to do before Oct 18:
1 Finish annotation of pictures
2 Create the patches of pictures (a patch extraction module that can work)

What we need to finish before November:
1 Build a baseline model

What we need to finish before December (final presentation):
1 Improve the baseline model

## First report:
Because we don’t have to work on feature Engineering, it is okay to put some basic statistical summary of pictures instead of the EDAV.

## General Model Idea suggested​ :
Annotate the colonies -> create patches of pictures -> train the model based on patches ->
predict whether this patch is from the background or a specific class.

Paridhi also talked about using different patch sizes and heatmaps to train the model.
