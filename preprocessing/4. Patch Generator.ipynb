    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## img_types:\n",
    "This is a list containing strings describing the type of images for which you wish to generate the patches. <br><br>\n",
    "As example, if you with to generate patches for 'Serial' and 'Control' types, use:\n",
    "__img_types = ['Serial', 'Control']__\n",
    "\n",
    "## val_type:\n",
    "\n",
    "String indicating the type of images to be used for model validation. It could be either 'Control', 'Serial', 'Strike' or None. <br><br>\n",
    "Since we performed image preprocessing for training only but most probably we won't be able to perform image preprocessing for test images (e.g. creating positive masks and then creating images with positive pixels only), we should validate our model on non-preprocessed image (natural images including petri-dish background and even petri-dish border). <br><br>\n",
    "The patches for the type of image indicated as val_type, will then be generated as patches from the original (non-preprocessed) images so we can better test/validate the performance of our model. If you still want all patches to be generated from preprocessed images, just include all types within __img_types__ and set __val_type = 'None'__\n",
    "\n",
    "## patch_types:\n",
    "This is also list containing strings describing the type of patches that you want to generate. Options are either 'Positive' or 'Negative' of both. 'Negative' patches are those patches still within the Petri-Dish but containing zero positive pixels (pixels actually corresponding bacterial colonies instead of petri-dish background, border, or noise). <br><br>\n",
    "As example, if you want to generate both Positive and Negative patches, use: __patch_types = ['Positive', 'Negative']__\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**Note:**</span>  Negative Patches will always be generated from natural images. As  example, negative patches will always including petri-dish background, even if we are generating positive patches with positive pixels only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## include_dish_border:\n",
    "Boolean to indicate whether you want training patches to include the petri-dish border or not.<br>\n",
    "True ->  include petri-dish border in training patches\n",
    "\n",
    "## positive_pixels_only:\n",
    "Boolean to indicate if you want the patches to contain positive pixels only (no petri-dish background nor petri-dish border).\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "![alt text](../notebook_pictures/positive_only.jpg \"example of patch with poxitive pixels only\")\n",
    "\n",
    "True-> positive pixels only. <br>\n",
    "False-> natural images including dish background. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If __positive_pixels_only = True__, then negative patches won't be generated, even if you include 'Negative' within the list for the parameter 'patch_types'. Similarly, no petri-dish broder will be included, even if you set include_dish_border = True.\n",
    "\n",
    "## patch_size:\n",
    "This is a tuple containing the size of the patches to be generate, in pixels (patch_width, patch_height).<br><br>\n",
    "As example, if you want to generate patches of 64 pixels width by 64 pixels height, use:  __patch_size = (64, 64)__\n",
    "\n",
    "## stride:\n",
    "Tuple with (horizontal_stride, vertical_stride). To generate the patches, a window with the desire patch_size will move around the original image, extracting the patches. This window will move from the left corner first horizontally (first 'row') and then it will move vertically before moving horizontally again (second row). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal stride will then correspond to the amount of pixels that the window will move to the right to generate the next patch. Similarly, the vertical stride will correspond to the amount of pixels that the window will move down to the next row of patches. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a toy example, in the picture below, the original image size is (6, 6) = 6x6 pixels, the patch_size is (3, 3) and the horizontal stride is 2:\n",

    "If horizontal_stride = patch_width, no patches will be overlapping horizontally. <br>\n",

    "The same applies for the vertical_stride and the patch_height.\n",
    "\n",
    "## val_stride:\n",

    "## min_pos_pixels:\n",
    "Integer. minimum amount of positive pixels in a patch for it to be classified as a positive patch. <br><br>\n",
    "For a patch to be considered positive, we need to define a desired threshold on how many positive pixels must each patch contain in order to be classified as positive. <br>\n",
    "If we set __min_pos_pixels = 1__, this means that a patch will be considered positive as long as it cotains a least one positive pixel. <br>\n",
    "If we set __min_pos_pixels = patch_width*patch_height__,this means that only thos patches containing 100% positive pixels, will be considered as positive. <br><br>\n",
    "As you can imagine, a good choice will probably be in-between. Be careful when requiring large minimums, as you may end up generating no positive patches at all.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ One option for the threshold to be used to determine if a patch is to be considered positive or not, could have been the percentage (%) of positive pixels within the patch. This opetion however has the issue that if we train our model and find that for example, selecting patches with 30% positive pixels works very well and we now try a larger patch size, 30% of a larger patch size would mean that many of the patches that were positive before will not be considered positive anymore and we could even have the situation where no patches would be considered positive at all. For that reason, we preferred to use the amount of positive pixels as threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## val_min_pos_pixels:\n",
    "Same concept than 'min_pos_pixels' (see above) but in this case it will be the minimum amount of positive pixels in a validatio patch for it to be classified as a positive validation patch, as you may wish a different threshold for training than for validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## rotations:\n",
    "List of integers from 0 to 360 or False. List with the amount of degrees to rotate the training images around the image center, for data augmentation. Rotations will be performed before extracting the patches so no information is lost. The image will be rotated as many times as the lenght of the list. As example, if __rotations = [0, 90, 180, 270]__, pathecs will be extracted from the original images rotated at 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If __rotations = [0] or [360] or None / False__, then no rotations will be performed for training images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## val_rotations:\n",
    "Same concept than 'rotations' (see above) but in this case it will be the list of degrees to rotate 'Validation' images around the image center before extracting patches, as you may wish different rotations (or not rotation at all) for validation images.\n",
    "\n",
